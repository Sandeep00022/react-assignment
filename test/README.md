Develop a full-stack Task Management System that enables users to manage their tasks efficiently. The application should allow users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks. The backend should use your choice of Spring Boot (Java stack) or Node.js (JavaScript stack) and the frontend should be implemented using Angular or React.js. The application must ensure scalability, responsiveness, and a user-friendly interface.
